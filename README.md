# FaceRecogonitionwithcnn

In this project, the user will first click his picture and then he will build a model and then he will be able to detect the live face. 

Requirments :

	import keras
  
	import cv2
  
	import numpy
  
	import pandas
  
	import os
	
	import matplotlib.pyplot
  
	from keras.models import Sequential
						
	from keras.layers import Convolution2D 
						
	from keras.layers import MaxPooling2D 
						
	from keras.layers import Flatten
						
	from keras.layers import Dense 	
					
	from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\
	
	from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
	
	from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model


This File is for detect the face to click only front face picture
	
	haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

Sequence way of run the program:

	First run the image_capture file
  
	then run the train_model file
  
	then run the livefacedetect file
  


# Note: Please donot delete any file from folder.
